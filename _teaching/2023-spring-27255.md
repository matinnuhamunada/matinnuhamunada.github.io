This is the bioinformatic tutorial for week 11 of the course [27255 - Advanced Experimental Prokaryotic Molecular Biology and Ecology (Spring 2023)](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2022-2023/27255?menulanguage=en) held at DTU Bioengineering. I was helping [Prof. Lars Jelsbak](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/lars-jelsbak) on the final part of the course where we sequence and analyze the genome information from the strain isolated by the students. The course material is available online [here](https://matinnuhamunada.github.io/27255_week_11/).

### Course Overview
> - On the last part of the course (week 10-12), you will learn how to obtain and analyze the DNA sequence of selected isolates to mine the DNA for relevant genetic information. First, you will extract DNA from your isolated pseudomonas (two per group) and subsequently prepare the DNA of a selected isolate for sequencing (one per group). The actual sequencing will be done using Nanopore MinION, a 3rd generation sequencing platform capable of real-time sequencing of very long reads (>200kb). You will perform sequence-based analysis using several online tools that will be presented in this tutorial.
>- In your analysis, you will specifically focus on: potential secondary metabolites, metabolic capabilities, antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity. The overall aim of week 10-12 is to obtain genomic information and study how it correlates with the phenotypic data you have obtained in the previous weeks. Finally, you will use all the data you have obtained throughout the course to evaluate your isolated strainsâ€™ potential and suitability as a production strain or for commercial use.
