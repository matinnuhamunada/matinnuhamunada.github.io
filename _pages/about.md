I am a Pre-Doctoral Student at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (DTU Biosustain). I am part of the [Natural Products Genome Mining research group led by Tilmann Weber](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/research/research-groups/natural-products-genome-mining-tilmann-weber). The group focuses on (1) developing and applying bioinformatics for genome mining of secondary/specialized metabolites and (2) developing tools enabling Actinobacteria cell factories for novel bioactive compound production and discoveries. In the group, I am interested to look into insights gained from microbial ecology and applies them as a data driven strategy to activate silent Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). I am collaborating with Center for Microbial Secondary Metabolites (CeMiST) at DTU Bioengineering to learn the roles of secondary metabolites in soil communities from Dyrehavn National Park, Denmark.  

Here you can find my blog, written in English or Indonesian, mostly about my learning processes and things I found interesting.
