I recently finished my PhD at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (DTU Biosustain). I am now working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Natural Products Genome Mining research group led by Tilmann Weber](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/research/research-groups/natural-products-genome-mining-tilmann-weber). The group focuses on (1) developing and applying bioinformatics for genome mining of secondary/specialized metabolites and (2) developing tools enabling Actinobacteria cell factories for novel bioactive compound production and discoveries. In the group, I am interested in looking into insights gained from microbial ecology and applies them as a data-driven strategy to activate silent Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). I am collaborating with the Center for Microbial Secondary Metabolites (CeMiST) at DTU Bioengineering to learn secondary metabolites roles in soil communities from Dyrehaven National Park, Denmark.

Here, you can find my blog, written in English or Indonesian, mostly about my learning processes and things I found interesting.
