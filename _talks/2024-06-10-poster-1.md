Third-generation sequencing technologies like Oxford Nanopore Technology enable affordable creation and management of private microbial strain collections, accelerating natural product discovery by mining biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs); BGCFlow is a comprehensive workflow integrating tools such as dbt, DuckDB, and Metabase to streamline data engineering, exploration, and management of these collections for both data scientists and lab researchers.
